92,1.1.91,There are a sort of men whose visages,GRATIANO
93,1.1.92,"Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,",GRATIANO
94,1.1.93,"And do a wilful stillness entertain,",GRATIANO
95,1.1.94,With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion,GRATIANO
96,1.1.95,"Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,",GRATIANO
97,1.1.96,"As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,",GRATIANO
98,1.1.97,And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!',GRATIANO

118,1.1.117,"Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more",BASSANIO
119,1.1.118,than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two,BASSANIO
120,1.1.119,grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you,BASSANIO

128,1.1.127,By something showing a more swelling port,BASSANIO
129,1.1.128,Than my faint means would grant continuance:,BASSANIO
130,1.1.129,Nor do I now make moan to be abridged,BASSANIO
131,1.1.130,From such a noble rate; but my chief care,BASSANIO
132,1.1.131,Is to come fairly off from the great debts,BASSANIO
133,1.1.132,Wherein my time something too prodigal,BASSANIO
134,1.1.133,"Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,",BASSANIO
135,1.1.134,"I owe the most, in money and in love,",BASSANIO

139,1.1.138,"I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;",ANTONIO
140,1.1.139,"And if it stand, as you yourself still do,",ANTONIO
141,1.1.140,"Within the eye of honour, be assured,",ANTONIO
142,1.1.141,"My purse, my person, my extremest means,",ANTONIO
143,1.1.142,Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.,ANTONIO
144,1.1.143,"In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,",BASSANIO
145,1.1.144,I shot his fellow of the self-same flight,BASSANIO
146,1.1.145,"The self-same way with more advised watch,",BASSANIO
147,1.1.146,"To find the other forth, and by adventuring both",BASSANIO
148,1.1.147,"I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,",BASSANIO

150,1.1.149,"I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,",BASSANIO
151,1.1.150,That which I owe is lost; but if you please,BASSANIO
152,1.1.151,To shoot another arrow that self way,BASSANIO
153,1.1.152,"Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,",BASSANIO
154,1.1.153,"As I will watch the aim, or to find both",BASSANIO

158,1.1.157,To wind about my love with circumstance;,ANTONIO
159,1.1.158,And out of doubt you do me now more wrong,ANTONIO
160,1.1.159,In making question of my uttermost,ANTONIO
161,1.1.160,Than if you had made waste of all I have:,ANTONIO
162,1.1.161,Then do but say to me what I should do,ANTONIO
163,1.1.162,"That in your knowledge may by me be done,",ANTONIO
164,1.1.163,"And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.",ANTONIO

166,1.1.165,"And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,",BASSANIO

168,1.1.167,I did receive fair speechless messages:,BASSANIO
169,1.1.168,"Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued",BASSANIO
170,1.1.169,"To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:",BASSANIO
171,1.1.170,"Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,",BASSANIO

182,1.1.181,Neither have I money nor commodity,ANTONIO
183,1.1.182,To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;,ANTONIO
184,1.1.183,Try what my credit can in Venice do:,ANTONIO
185,1.1.184,"That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,",ANTONIO

188,1.1.187,"Where money is, and I no question make",ANTONIO
189,1.1.188,To have it of my trust or for my sake.,ANTONIO
190,1.1.189,SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.,ANTONIO
191,1.1.190,"By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of",PORTIA
192,1.1.191,this great world.,PORTIA
193,1.1.192,"You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in",NERISSA
194,1.1.193,the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and,NERISSA
195,1.1.194,"yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit",NERISSA
196,1.1.195,with too much as they that starve with nothing. It,NERISSA
197,1.1.196,"is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the",NERISSA
198,1.1.197,"mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but",NERISSA
199,1.1.198,competency lives longer.,NERISSA
200,1.1.199,Good sentences and well pronounced.,PORTIA
201,1.1.200,"They would be better, if well followed.",NERISSA

203,1.1.202,"do, chapels had been churches and poor men's",PORTIA
204,1.1.203,cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that,PORTIA
205,1.1.204,follows his own instructions: I can easier teach,PORTIA
206,1.1.205,"twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the",PORTIA
207,1.1.206,twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may,PORTIA
208,1.1.207,"devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps",PORTIA
209,1.1.208,o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the,PORTIA
210,1.1.209,"youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the",PORTIA
211,1.1.210,cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to,PORTIA
212,1.1.211,"choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may",PORTIA
213,1.1.212,neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I,PORTIA
214,1.1.213,dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed,PORTIA

221,1.1.220,"chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any",NERISSA

225,1.1.224,"I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest",PORTIA

228,1.1.227,"First, there is the Neapolitan prince.",NERISSA
229,1.1.228,"Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but",PORTIA
230,1.1.229,talk of his horse; and he makes it a great,PORTIA
231,1.1.230,"appropriation to his own good parts, that he can",PORTIA
232,1.1.231,shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his,PORTIA

234,1.1.233,Then there is the County Palatine.,NERISSA
235,1.1.234,"He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you",PORTIA
236,1.1.235,"will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and",PORTIA

238,1.1.237,"philosopher when he grows old, being so full of",PORTIA
239,1.1.238,unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be,PORTIA
240,1.1.239,married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth,PORTIA

250,1.1.249,"fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I",PORTIA
