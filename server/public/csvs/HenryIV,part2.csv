186,1.1.144,"A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,",MORTON
187,1.1.145,Under the conduct of young Lancaster,MORTON
188,1.1.146,And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.,MORTON
189,1.1.147,For this I shall have time enough to mourn.,NORTHUMBERLAND

192,1.1.150,"Being sick, have in some measure made me well:",NORTHUMBERLAND

205,1.1.163,To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!,NORTHUMBERLAND
206,1.1.164,Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand,NORTHUMBERLAND
207,1.1.165,Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!,NORTHUMBERLAND
208,1.1.166,And let this world no longer be a stage,NORTHUMBERLAND
209,1.1.167,To feed contention in a lingering act;,NORTHUMBERLAND
210,1.1.168,But let one spirit of the first-born Cain,NORTHUMBERLAND

224,1.1.182,More likely to fall in than to get o'er;,MORTON
225,1.1.183,You were advised his flesh was capable,MORTON
226,1.1.184,Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit,MORTON
227,1.1.185,Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:,MORTON
228,1.1.186,"Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,",MORTON

275,1.2.7,"able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more",FALSTAFF
276,1.2.8,than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only,FALSTAFF
277,1.2.9,"witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other",FALSTAFF
278,1.2.10,men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that,FALSTAFF
279,1.2.11,hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the,FALSTAFF
280,1.2.12,prince put thee into my service for any other reason,FALSTAFF

282,1.2.14,"Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn",FALSTAFF

286,1.2.18,"send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--",FALSTAFF
287,1.2.19,"the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is",FALSTAFF
288,1.2.20,not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in,FALSTAFF
289,1.2.21,the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his,FALSTAFF
290,1.2.22,cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is,FALSTAFF
291,1.2.23,"a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis",FALSTAFF
292,1.2.24,not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a,FALSTAFF
