185,1.2.76,"prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more",FALSTAFF
186,1.2.77,with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a,FALSTAFF
187,1.2.78,commodity of good names were to be bought. An old,FALSTAFF
188,1.2.79,lord of the council rated me the other day in the,FALSTAFF
189,1.2.80,"street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet",FALSTAFF

197,1.2.88,"thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man",FALSTAFF
198,1.2.89,"should speak truly, little better than one of the",FALSTAFF

221,1.2.112,"Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have",PRINCE HENRY
222,1.2.113,his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of,PRINCE HENRY
223,1.2.114,proverbs: he will give the devil his due.,PRINCE HENRY
224,1.2.115,Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.,POINS
225,1.2.116,Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.,PRINCE HENRY

241,1.2.132,"There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good",FALSTAFF

268,1.2.159,"appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at",POINS
269,1.2.160,"our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure",POINS
270,1.2.161,upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have,POINS
271,1.2.162,"no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.",POINS
