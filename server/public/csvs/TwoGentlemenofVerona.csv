254,1.2.109," Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!",JULIA
255,1.2.110,"O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!",JULIA
256,1.2.111,"Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey",JULIA
257,1.2.112,And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!,JULIA
258,1.2.113,I'll kiss each several paper for amends.,JULIA
