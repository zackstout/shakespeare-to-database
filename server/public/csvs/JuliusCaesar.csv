146,1.2.71,"Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:",CASSIUS
147,1.2.72,And since you know you cannot see yourself,CASSIUS

168,1.2.93,"And I will look on both indifferently,",BRUTUS

171,1.2.96,"I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,",CASSIUS
172,1.2.97,As well as I do know your outward favour.,CASSIUS
173,1.2.98,"Well, honour is the subject of my story.",CASSIUS

186,1.2.111,"Accoutred as I was, I plunged in",CASSIUS
187,1.2.112,And bade him follow; so indeed he did.,CASSIUS
188,1.2.113,"The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it",CASSIUS
189,1.2.114,"With lusty sinews, throwing it aside",CASSIUS
190,1.2.115,And stemming it with hearts of controversy;,CASSIUS
191,1.2.116,"But ere we could arrive the point proposed,",CASSIUS
192,1.2.117,"Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'",CASSIUS
193,1.2.118,"I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,",CASSIUS

195,1.2.120,"The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber",CASSIUS
196,1.2.121,Did I the tired Caesar. And this man,CASSIUS

199,1.2.124,If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.,CASSIUS
200,1.2.125,"He had a fever when he was in Spain,",CASSIUS
201,1.2.126,"And when the fit was on him, I did mark",CASSIUS
202,1.2.127,"How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;",CASSIUS
203,1.2.128,"His coward lips did from their colour fly,",CASSIUS
204,1.2.129,And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world,CASSIUS
205,1.2.130,Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:,CASSIUS
206,1.2.131,"Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans",CASSIUS
207,1.2.132,"Mark him and write his speeches in their books,",CASSIUS
208,1.2.133,"Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'",CASSIUS
209,1.2.134,"As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me",CASSIUS
210,1.2.135,A man of such a feeble temper should,CASSIUS
211,1.2.136,So get the start of the majestic world,CASSIUS
212,1.2.137,And bear the palm alone.,CASSIUS
213,1.2.138,Another general shout!,BRUTUS
214,1.2.139,I do believe that these applauses are,BRUTUS
215,1.2.140,For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.,BRUTUS
216,1.2.141,"Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world",CASSIUS
217,1.2.142,"Like a Colossus, and we petty men",CASSIUS

236,1.2.161,That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?,CASSIUS
237,1.2.162,"Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,",CASSIUS
238,1.2.163,When there is in it but one only man.,CASSIUS
239,1.2.164,"O, you and I have heard our fathers say,",CASSIUS
240,1.2.165,There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd,CASSIUS

247,1.2.172,"I would not, so with love I might entreat you,",BRUTUS
248,1.2.173,Be any further moved. What you have said,BRUTUS
249,1.2.174,I will consider; what you have to say,BRUTUS
250,1.2.175,"I will with patience hear, and find a time",BRUTUS
251,1.2.176,Both meet to hear and answer such high things.,BRUTUS
252,1.2.177,"Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:",BRUTUS
253,1.2.178,Brutus had rather be a villager,BRUTUS
254,1.2.179,Than to repute himself a son of Rome,BRUTUS

256,1.2.181,Is like to lay upon us.,BRUTUS
257,1.2.182,I am glad that my weak words,CASSIUS
258,1.2.183,Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.,CASSIUS
259,1.2.184,The games are done and Caesar is returning.,BRUTUS
260,1.2.185,"As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;",CASSIUS

265,1.2.190,And all the rest look like a chidden train:,BRUTUS
266,1.2.191,Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero,BRUTUS
267,1.2.192,Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes,BRUTUS
268,1.2.193,"As we have seen him in the Capitol,",BRUTUS
269,1.2.194,Being cross'd in conference by some senators.,BRUTUS

286,1.2.211,"Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort",CAESAR

308,1.2.233,Was the crown offered him thrice?,BRUTUS
309,1.2.234,"Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every",CASCA
310,1.2.235,"time gentler than other, and at every putting-by",CASCA
311,1.2.236,mine honest neighbours shouted.,CASCA
312,1.2.237,Who offered him the crown?,CASSIUS

314,1.2.239,"Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.",BRUTUS
315,1.2.240,I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:,CASCA
316,1.2.241,it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark,CASCA
317,1.2.242,Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown,CASCA
318,1.2.243,"neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told",CASCA
319,1.2.244,"you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my",CASCA
320,1.2.245,"thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he",CASCA
321,1.2.246,offered it to him again; then he put it by again:,CASCA
322,1.2.247,"but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his",CASCA
323,1.2.248,fingers off it. And then he offered it the third,CASCA
324,1.2.249,time; he put it the third time by: and still as he,CASCA
325,1.2.250,"refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their",CASCA
326,1.2.251,chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps,CASCA
327,1.2.252,and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because,CASCA
328,1.2.253,Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked,CASCA
329,1.2.254,Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and,CASCA
330,1.2.255,"for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of",CASCA
331,1.2.256,opening my lips and receiving the bad air.,CASCA
332,1.2.257,"But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?",CASSIUS
333,1.2.258,"He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at",CASCA
334,1.2.259,"mouth, and was speechless.",CASCA
335,1.2.260,'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.,BRUTUS
336,1.2.261,"No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,",CASSIUS

338,1.2.263,"I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,",CASCA
339,1.2.264,Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not,CASCA
340,1.2.265,"clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and",CASCA
341,1.2.266,"displeased them, as they use to do the players in",CASCA
342,1.2.267,"the theatre, I am no true man.",CASCA
343,1.2.268,What said he when he came unto himself?,BRUTUS
344,1.2.269,"Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the",CASCA
345,1.2.270,"common herd was glad he refused the crown, he",CASCA
346,1.2.271,plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his,CASCA
347,1.2.272,throat to cut. An I had been a man of any,CASCA
348,1.2.273,"occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,",CASCA
349,1.2.274,I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so,CASCA
350,1.2.275,"he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,",CASCA
351,1.2.276,"If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired",CASCA
352,1.2.277,their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three,CASCA
353,1.2.278,"or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good",CASCA
354,1.2.279,soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but,CASCA
355,1.2.280,there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had,CASCA
356,1.2.281,"stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.",CASCA
357,1.2.282,"And after that, he came, thus sad, away?",BRUTUS

362,1.2.287,"Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the",CASCA

364,1.2.289,"one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own",CASCA
365,1.2.290,"part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more",CASCA
366,1.2.291,"news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs",CASCA
367,1.2.292,"off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you",CASCA
