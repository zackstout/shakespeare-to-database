2,1.1.1,I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon,LEONATO
3,1.1.2,comes this night to Messina.,LEONATO
4,1.1.3,He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off,Messenger
5,1.1.4,when I left him.,Messenger
6,1.1.5,How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?,LEONATO
7,1.1.6,"But few of any sort, and none of name.",Messenger
8,1.1.7,A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings,LEONATO
9,1.1.8,home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath,LEONATO
10,1.1.9,bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.,LEONATO
11,1.1.10,Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by,Messenger
12,1.1.11,Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the,Messenger
13,1.1.12,"promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,",Messenger
14,1.1.13,the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better,Messenger
15,1.1.14,bettered expectation than you must expect of me to,Messenger
16,1.1.15,tell you how.,Messenger
17,1.1.16,He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much,LEONATO
18,1.1.17,glad of it.,LEONATO
19,1.1.18,"I have already delivered him letters, and there",Messenger
20,1.1.19,appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could,Messenger
21,1.1.20,not show itself modest enough without a badge of,Messenger
22,1.1.21,bitterness.,Messenger
23,1.1.22,Did he break out into tears?,LEONATO
24,1.1.23,In great measure.,Messenger
25,1.1.24,A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces,LEONATO
26,1.1.25,truer than those that are so washed. How much,LEONATO
27,1.1.26,better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!,LEONATO
28,1.1.27,"I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the",BEATRICE
29,1.1.28,wars or no?,BEATRICE
30,1.1.29,"I know none of that name, lady: there was none such",Messenger
31,1.1.30,in the army of any sort.,Messenger
32,1.1.31,"What is he that you ask for, niece?",LEONATO
33,1.1.32,My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.,HERO
34,1.1.33,"O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.",Messenger
35,1.1.34,He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged,BEATRICE
36,1.1.35,"Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading",BEATRICE
37,1.1.36,"the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged",BEATRICE
38,1.1.37,"him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he",BEATRICE
39,1.1.38,killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath,BEATRICE
40,1.1.39,he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.,BEATRICE
41,1.1.40,"Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;",LEONATO
42,1.1.41,"but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.",LEONATO
43,1.1.42,"He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.",Messenger
44,1.1.43,"You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:",BEATRICE
45,1.1.44,he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an,BEATRICE
46,1.1.45,excellent stomach.,BEATRICE
47,1.1.46,"And a good soldier too, lady.",Messenger
48,1.1.47,And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?,BEATRICE
49,1.1.48,"A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all",Messenger
50,1.1.49,honourable virtues.,Messenger
51,1.1.50,"It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:",BEATRICE
52,1.1.51,"but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.",BEATRICE
53,1.1.52,"You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a",LEONATO
54,1.1.53,kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:,LEONATO
55,1.1.54,they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit,LEONATO
56,1.1.55,between them.,LEONATO
57,1.1.56,Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last,BEATRICE
58,1.1.57,"conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and",BEATRICE
59,1.1.58,now is the whole man governed with one: so that if,BEATRICE
60,1.1.59,"he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him",BEATRICE
61,1.1.60,bear it for a difference between himself and his,BEATRICE
62,1.1.61,"horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,",BEATRICE
63,1.1.62,to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his,BEATRICE
64,1.1.63,companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.,BEATRICE
65,1.1.64,Is't possible?,Messenger
66,1.1.65,Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as,BEATRICE
67,1.1.66,the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the,BEATRICE
68,1.1.67,next block.,BEATRICE
69,1.1.68,"I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.",Messenger
70,1.1.69,"No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray",BEATRICE
71,1.1.70,"you, who is his companion? Is there no young",BEATRICE
72,1.1.71,squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?,BEATRICE
73,1.1.72,He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.,Messenger
74,1.1.73,"O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he",BEATRICE
75,1.1.74,"is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker",BEATRICE
76,1.1.75,runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if,BEATRICE
77,1.1.76,"he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a",BEATRICE
78,1.1.77,thousand pound ere a' be cured.,BEATRICE
79,1.1.78,"I will hold friends with you, lady.",Messenger

83,1.1.82,Don Pedro is approached.,Messenger
84,1.1.83,"Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your",DON PEDRO
85,1.1.84,trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid,DON PEDRO
86,1.1.85,"cost, and you encounter it.",DON PEDRO
87,1.1.86,Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of,LEONATO
88,1.1.87,"your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should",LEONATO
89,1.1.88,"remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides",LEONATO
90,1.1.89,and happiness takes his leave.,LEONATO
91,1.1.90,You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this,DON PEDRO
92,1.1.91,is your daughter.,DON PEDRO
93,1.1.92,Her mother hath many times told me so.,LEONATO
94,1.1.93,"Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?",BENEDICK
95,1.1.94,"Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.",LEONATO
96,1.1.95,"You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this",DON PEDRO
97,1.1.96,"what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers",DON PEDRO
98,1.1.97,"herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an",DON PEDRO
99,1.1.98,honourable father.,DON PEDRO
100,1.1.99,"If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not",BENEDICK
101,1.1.100,"have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as",BENEDICK
102,1.1.101,like him as she is.,BENEDICK
103,1.1.102,"I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior",BEATRICE
104,1.1.103,Benedick: nobody marks you.,BEATRICE
105,1.1.104,"What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?",BENEDICK
106,1.1.105,Is it possible disdain should die while she hath,BEATRICE
107,1.1.106,such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?,BEATRICE
108,1.1.107,"Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come",BEATRICE
109,1.1.108,in her presence.,BEATRICE
110,1.1.109,Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I,BENEDICK
111,1.1.110,"am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I",BENEDICK
112,1.1.111,would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard,BENEDICK
113,1.1.112,"heart; for, truly, I love none.",BENEDICK
114,1.1.113,A dear happiness to women: they would else have,BEATRICE
115,1.1.114,been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God,BEATRICE
116,1.1.115,"and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I",BEATRICE
117,1.1.116,had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man,BEATRICE
118,1.1.117,swear he loves me.,BEATRICE
119,1.1.118,God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some,BENEDICK
120,1.1.119,gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate,BENEDICK

128,1.1.127,name; I have done.,BENEDICK
129,1.1.128,You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.,BEATRICE
130,1.1.129,"That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio",DON PEDRO
131,1.1.130,"and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath",DON PEDRO
132,1.1.131,invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at,DON PEDRO
133,1.1.132,the least a month; and he heartily prays some,DON PEDRO
134,1.1.133,occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no,DON PEDRO

146,1.1.145,"Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for",BENEDICK
147,1.1.146,my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak,BENEDICK
148,1.1.147,"after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?",BENEDICK
149,1.1.148,No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.,CLAUDIO

151,1.1.150,"praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little",BENEDICK
152,1.1.151,for a great praise: only this commendation I can,BENEDICK

158,1.1.157,"Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?",BENEDICK
159,1.1.158,Can the world buy such a jewel?,CLAUDIO
160,1.1.159,"Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this",BENEDICK
161,1.1.160,"with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,",BENEDICK
