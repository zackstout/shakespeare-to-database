108,1.1.107,Are you meditating on virginity?,PAROLLES
109,1.1.108,Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me,HELENA

124,1.1.123,is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to,PAROLLES
125,1.1.124,preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational,PAROLLES
126,1.1.125,increase and there was never virgin got till,PAROLLES
127,1.1.126,virginity was first lost. That you were made of is,PAROLLES
128,1.1.127,metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost,PAROLLES

132,1.1.131,There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the,PAROLLES

134,1.1.133,is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible,PAROLLES
135,1.1.134,disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:,PAROLLES
136,1.1.135,virginity murders itself and should be buried in,PAROLLES
137,1.1.136,"highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate",PAROLLES
138,1.1.137,"offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,",PAROLLES

140,1.1.139,"paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.",PAROLLES
141,1.1.140,"Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of",PAROLLES
142,1.1.141,"self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the",PAROLLES
143,1.1.142,canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose,PAROLLES

146,1.1.145,principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!,PAROLLES

148,1.1.147,"Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it",PAROLLES
149,1.1.148,likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with,PAROLLES

154,1.1.153,"like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not",PAROLLES
155,1.1.154,now. Your date is better in your pie and your,PAROLLES
156,1.1.155,"porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,",PAROLLES
157,1.1.156,"your old virginity, is like one of our French",PAROLLES
