# Shakespeare to Database
Once and for all converting those CSVs we scraped into a SQL database.


## Next Steps:
- [ ] Build the display for definitions/synonyms of hovered-over words.
- [ ] Clear DOM when user inputs new play.
- [ ] Add "next page" buttons for next 500 lines (and previous).
- [x] Better: load next 100 lines when user has scrolled to bottom.
- [x] Let user search for a speaker; only show all those speakers' lines.
- [ ] Let user search for a given pattern of text in the play; display all filtered results (with speakers).
- [ ] Let user filter all scenes involving any combination of characters.
- [x] A chart to represent changing overall sentiment as the play progresses.
- [x] Still need to refine chart based on min/max sentiment of the play in question.
- [ ] The labels are going to be a bit involved, if we want to show where act divisions occur.
- [ ] Could also likely make sentiment analysis more sophisticated by parsing by chunks or clauses.
- [ ] Bring in [WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/).
- [ ] Hook up to NLTK via Python.
- [ ] Show frequency distribution of a word/phrase/speaker along with list of all relevant contexts.
