# Shakespeare to Database
Once and for all converting those CSVs we scraped into a SQL database.


## Next Steps:
- [ ] Build the display for definitions/synonyms of hovered-over words.
- [ ] Clear DOM when user inputs new play.
- [ ] Add "next page" buttons for next 500 lines (and previous).
- [ ] Let user search for a speaker; only show all those speakers' lines.
- [ ] Let user search for a given pattern of text in the play; display all filtered results (with speakers).
- [ ] Let user filter all scenes involving any combination of characters.
